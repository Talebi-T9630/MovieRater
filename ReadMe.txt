/* Movie Rater*/

Steps to running this software: 

First:
Import the MoviesList.json and Reviews.json to mongodb inside the
collection called moviesDB.

Second:
npm  start the nodejsSide folder in VSC.

Third:
npm start the movie-rater folder in VSC.


CRUD operations:
The movies are read from the Database.
Comments can be Added to the Database according to each movies.
Comments can be Deleted from the Database according to each movie.
Comments can be edited (but they can only be hardcoded).


The purpose of this software is to introduce all movies and their raitings based on the societies point of view. Users can leave comments for specific movies, they then can edit,delete, 
or even add more comments. This current prototype only has the top 25 movies of history and some sample comments both imported from our databases. Hopefully we can expand this app to make
it as big IMDB one day.

The list of movies was initially taken through an API call and then transported to the Database as the top 25 movies in history.

new feature- added emailjs to be able to receive the email from the customers. Please send us an email if you liked this project.
